the beginning
A fishing boat and a sea of regret ful loss.  A hopeful fisherwoman and her captain riding the endless waves trying to hold in their breakfast...salmon fresh from the sea is like nothing she had ever tasted before.  Frying it up in a dutch oven pan and making breakfast was her favorite thing about that summer.
